# HTML Tools

Single-file HTML utilities that run entirely in the browser — no backend, no build step, and designed to work well on mobile and desktop.

Each tool lives in its own `.html` file with inline HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To keep dependencies low, each tool should be self-contained and use as few external libraries as possible, falling back to well-known CDN-hosted scripts only when needed.
